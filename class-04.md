    Links are created using the <a> element. The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to If you are linking to a page within your own site, it isbest to use relative links rather than qualified URLs You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field, You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

# LAYOUT

> <div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.

> Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

> The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

> Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts. 

> Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

# Functions, Methods, and Objects

Browsers require very detailed instructions about what we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use
functions, methods, and objects to organize their code. 

- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.
- Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value.
- An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.
- In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object. 


JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts. 


## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming 
by [codefellows](https://www.codefellows.org/)

 > At Code Fellows, pair programing is one way we foster a collaborative environment while developing key industry skills. but   **Why pair program?**

While learning to code, developers likely study several programming languages. Similar to a foreign language class, there are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language: Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful

Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to othersâ€™ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.
