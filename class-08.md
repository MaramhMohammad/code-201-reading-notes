The very first book which you should prefer in learning is HTML and CSS: Design and build websites by Jon Duckett.


The author has made very sensible decision that a book on web design should be well designed, should look inviting and should show as much as it tells. The full color photos
,magazine style layouts and infographic style llustration make it so much easier to understand the code and use it to produce great web design.


In Layout Chapter you are going to look at how to control where each element sits on a page and how to create attractive page layouts

### Key Concepts in Positioning Elements

**Building Blocks**

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

**Containing Elements**

If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.
It is common to group a number of elements together inside a <div> (or other block-level) element. For example, you might group together all of the elements that form the header of a site (such as the logo and
the main navigation). The <div> element that contains this group of elements is then referred to as the containing element.


**Controlling the Position of Elements**

CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

### Normal flow 

The paragraphs appear one after the other, vertically down the page.

### Relative Positioning

The second paragraph has been pushed down and right from where it would otherwise have been in normal flow.

### Absolute positioning

The heading is positioned to the top right, and the paragraphs start at the top of the screen (as if the heading were not there).

Essentially, if you are new to web development, or you are a Javascript developer who wants to have a better understanding of HTML & CSS â€” you should definitely read this book. 
This book is very good for beginners and can be used as a reference manual.
Over the 519 pages you will learn HTML & CSS that will assist you in getting the job done with any website.

##### SHORT SUMMARY OF LAYOUT 

- <div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
