## FUNCTIONS  , METHODS & OBJECTS   
Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task. 

Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value. 

An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you. 

In an object, variables are known as properties of the Vobject; functions are known as methods of the object. 

Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window. 

JavaScript also has several built-in objects such asString, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.

Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).

## document object model

The browser represents the page using a DOM tree. 

DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes,element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.

You can select element nodes by their id or cl assattributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax. 

Whenever a DOM query can return more than one node, it will always return a Nadel i st. 

From an element node, you can access and update its content using properties such as textContent and i nnerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.

An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other. 

In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery).

Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree .

## Programming is easy if you understand the problem domain

The reason why puzzles like this one are so hard, is because you canâ€™t really see what you are trying to build very clearly.  Normally when you put together a jigsaw puzzle you follow steps that might look something like this:

- Figure out what the major components of the picture are
- Sort the pieces by color or component
- Put together all the border pieces
- Put together each component of the picture from the piles you created
