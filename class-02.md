# HTML
> have you ever wondered How to add markup to the text that appears on pages! 

**HTML** is easy to learn - You will enjoy it! 

First you have to understand: 
- Structural markup
- Semantic markup 

When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.

Html elements are used to describe the structure of  the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation)

```
Headings <h1> ... <h6> 
Paragraphs <p>
Bold & Italic <b> <i>
Superscript & Subscrip <sup> <sub>
```

# how to make your web pages more attractive, controlling the design of them using CSS.

[CSS](https://wtf.tw/ref/duckett.pdf) treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look, Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like) !

Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface

```
p.a {
  font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
}

p.b {
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
```

# Js 
when you start learning to read and write JavaScript you will know how to give a web browser instructions you want it to follow. 

A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe. Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value. 


Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script and JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 

### [JavaScript](http://javascriptbook.com/) Loops 

Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.

Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next, Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
