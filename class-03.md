#  HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists. HTML provides us with three different types:
- Ordered lists
- Unordered lists
- Definition lists

Ordered lists use numbers, Unordered lists use bulletsm  and Definition lists are used to define terminology .. Lists can be nested inside one another.

# **BOXES**  

CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box. 

X You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
 
You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS
 
It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties

```
div.card {
  width: 250px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19);
  text-align: center;
}

```

#  JS

when you start learning to read and write JavaScript you will know how to give a web browser instructions you want it to follow.

A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe. Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.

Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script and JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).


### DECISIONS & LOOPS 


Conditional statements allow your code to make  decisions about what to do next.

```
Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
are used to compare two operands. 
```
Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
