A Simple HTML Document

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

- You can add comments to your code between the

```<!--  and --> markers.```

       <!-- comment goes here -->
       
- Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.
- The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements
- The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.

### HTML5 
The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.

To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.* ( [source](https://wtf.tw/ref/duckett.pdf) )

### Process & Design
Every website should be designed for the target audience—not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.

Now that you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages.

Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.

Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
