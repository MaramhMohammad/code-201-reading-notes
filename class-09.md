# HTML 

### Forms 
A  form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing. 
Whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a < form > element.
Form Controls 
HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it  easier for visitors to fill in forms.

**There are several types of form controls that you can use to collect information from visitors to your site.**

- ADDING TEXT
- Password input
- Text area (multi-line)
- Making Choices
- Radio buttons
- Checkboxes
- Drop-down boxes 
- Submitting Forms
- Uploading Files

A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server
Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server.

Form Structure


The HTML < form > element is used to create an HTML form for user input:
```
<form action="http://www.example.com/subscribe.php"
method="get">
<p>This is where the form controls will appear.
 </p>
</form>
```

**Text Input**

### Lists, Tables & Forms

There are several CSS properties that were created to work with specific types of HTML elements, such as lists, tables,
and forms.

In addition to the CSS properties covered in other chapters which work with the contents of all elements, there are several others that are specifically used to
control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.

List markers can be given different appearances using the list-style-type and list-style image properties.

Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can
use to control them and make them more consistent. 

# JS 

### Events

Events are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened (such as when a page has finished loading or a button has been clicked). Binding is the process of stating which event you are
waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon. 

When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function. When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because
it has responded to the user.
