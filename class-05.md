# Images
## A picture can say a thousand words, 
and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.

**How to add images to pages** 
The <img> element is used to add images to a web page.
You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.

Height & Width  of Images

Images often take longer to load than the HTML code that makes up the rest of the page. It is, therefore, a good idea tospecify the size of the image
so that the browser can render the rest of the text on the page while leaving the right amount of space for the image that is still loading.

# Color
## Color can really bring your pages to life

Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

Color picking tools are available in image editing programs like Photoshop and GIMP. You can see the RGB values specified next to the radio buttons that say R, G, B.

There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names

Color pickers can help you find the color you want.

It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).

CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA


# Text

There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing.
There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed.

You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.

You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
when they have visited a link.


## [TL;DR](https://blog.imagekit.io/jpeg-vs-png-vs-gif-which-image-format-to-use-and-when-c8913ae3e01d)

- Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth.

- Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos.

- Use GIF format for images that contain animations.

 these 3 image formats have significant differences amongst themselves thus making each of them suitable for specific use cases.
 
 Understanding these major differences would help us deliver the best possible images to our website and mobile app users.
