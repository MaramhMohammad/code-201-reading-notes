# Audio, Video, Images 

### IMAGES 

- **Controlling sizes of images in CSS**: You can control the size of images using the height and width properties on CSS, just like you can for any other box. Specifying the images size makes the page load faster.

- **Aligning images using CSS**: There are two ways to use FLOAT:
  - The FLOAT property was added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image. 
  - New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images to the left or right of the page. 

- **Centering images using CSS**: By default, images are inline elements. This means that they flow within the surrounding text. In order to center an image, it should be turned into a block-level element using the display property with a value of block. There are then two ways that you can horizontally center an image: 
  - On the containing element, you can use the text-align property with a value of center. 
  - On the image itself, you can use the margin property with a value of the left or right margins to auto.

- **Background images**: The `background-image` property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page.

- **Repeating Images**: The `background-repeat` property can have four values: 
  - repeat: repeated horizontally and vertically.
  - repeat-x: repeated horizontally.
  - repeat-y: repeated vertically.
  - no-repeat: shown only once.

- The `background-attachment` property specifies whether a background image should stay in one position or move as the user scrolls up and down the page. I can have two values:
  - fixed: stays in position
  - scroll: moves with user.

- **Background position**: When an image is not being repeated, you can use `background-position` to specify where in the browser window it should be placed. This property uses a pair of values. The first represents the horizontal position of the image, and the second represents the vertical position of the image.

- Shorthand: The `background` property acts is kind of like a shorthand for all of the other background properties, including the `background-color` property.

- Image Rollovers and Sprites: Using CSS, it is possible to create a link or button that changes to a second style when a user moves their mouse over it.

- Contrast of background images: If you want to overlay text on a background image, the image must be low-contrast for the text to be legible.
